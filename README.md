# Full-Stack-PUSL3120-Routine
------------------------------
This public repository contains the source code of Routine web application project that I developed for one of my university projects.
Specific Module Code: PUSL3120 (Full-Stack Development).

Angular - MongoDB - ExpressJS - NodeJS (MEAN Stack)

".angular" and "node_modules" contents are not included.

Important notice to module leader Dr. Mark Dixon : Though I pushed each file to GitHub within the same day that they were created, as an extention was given, I modified them and reuploaded in a single push. But prior to the given deadline.
